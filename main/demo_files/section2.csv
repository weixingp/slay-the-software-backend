What is a design problem Strategy Pattern solves?,A set of algorithms or objects should be interchangeable,We need the system to be able to strategise,Which algorithm or object to instantiate is to be determined at runtime,When there is only one strategy to use,1,1
Which of the following is NOT an advantage of using Strategy Pattern?,Provides encapsulation,Hides implementation,Allows behaviour change at runtime,Reduces code complexity,4,1
Which of the following is a disadvantage of using Strategy Pattern?,Provides encapsulation,Increases code complexity if overused,Does not allow behaviour change at runtime,Allows for easy extension for new strategies,2,1
When should we use Observer Pattern?,When we need many objects to receive an update when another object changes,When we need to observe the system very closely,When the system is too small to be observed properly,When we need to continuously listen to an object for updates,1,1
Which of the following pair of terms is NOT associated with Observer Pattern?,Subscriber-Publisher,Observer-Subject,Host-Parasite,Consumer-Producer,3,1
With reference to the Baby-Caregiver example: which is NOT a reason to use Observer Pattern from the perspective of the Baby?,I do not care who is looking or how many are looking after me,I want to let my caregiver know why I am crying,It is up to the caregiver to decide what to do about me crying,I want to let whoever is looking after me know when I cry,2,2
With reference to the Baby-Caregiver example: which is NOT a reason to use Observer Pattern from the perspective of the Caregiver?,Sometimes I want to look after the baby but sometimes I do not,I want to know when the baby cries but I do not know when that is exactly,I cannot keep checking on the baby because I have to do something else important,I want to ignore when the baby cries and let someone else deal with him,4,2
Which of the following is NOT a notification mechanism in Observer Pattern?,Pull,Push,Push then Pull,Pull then Push,4,2
Which of the following is a disadvantage of using Observer Pattern?,Slower performance,Faster performance,Results in tighter coupling,Prevents the reuse of subjects and observers independently of each other,1,2
Which of the following is an advantage of using Observer Pattern?,Prevents the reuse of subjects and observers independently of each other,Abstracts coupling between Subject and Observer,Removes broadcast communication support,Faster performance,2,2
When can we use Factory Pattern?,When we have a set of classes but do not know which one to instantiate until runtime,When the behaviour of the system can change throughout the execution of the system,When we only need to instantiate one class,When the system is to be used in factories under extreme conditions,1,3
Which of the following is NOT a design problem Factory Pattern solves?,Existing subclasses can be replaced or new subclasses can be added,Process of selecting subclass to use and creating object can be complex,Client wants to change which class is used at different times of the system execution,Client does not know ahead of time which class will be used and the class can be chosen at runtime,4,3
Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using Factory Pattern?,Encapsulation of object creation,Extending new subclasses can be done easily,Object creation logic can be easily changed,Object creation must be performed quickly,4,3
Which of the following design principles is used in Façade Pattern?,Modularization,Principle of Least Knowledge,Single Responsibility Principle,Open-Closed Principle,2,3
What is an advantage of using Façade Pattern?,Code is made easier to use and understand,Dependencies on classes are reduced,Less rework is needed if the Façade class is improperly designed,Client is decoupled from a complex system,3,3
